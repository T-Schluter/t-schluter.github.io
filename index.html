                <h2> About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I am currently a Fixed Plant Controller for BHP’s Integrated Remote Operations Center (IROC+), based in Brisbane. I have had a passion for data throughout my entire professional career – starting as a laboratory technician through to water treatment operator for Origin energy and now with BHP as a fixed plant controller. I have 8 years processing experience across multiple control systems, computer software and data visualisation, recording and reporting tools.
                <br>
                <br>
                I am participating in SHE{CODES} Plus program to learn programming skills to further my career, and learn how to take my passion for data, automation and continious improvement to a new level.
                <br>
                <br>
                Outside of work I appreciate good food, good wine and good company. I also enjoy travelling and new life experiences and while my bucket list is long – it is getting there. I have a soft spot for animals and in particular my black and white cat – “Boots”.
